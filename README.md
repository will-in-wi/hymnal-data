# Hymnal Index

I have a project I'm working on, which involves indexing data from various hymnals. I can't find, in many cases, a decent, non-copyrighted listing of the data I need. So I'm making my own.

This repo is an index of hymns to which I waive all copyright that could result from my work. Any copyright held by the original holders, of course, persists. I will note each hymnal's copyright information next to it.

## Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal
